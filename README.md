# Mega_Note_Taker

## Description 
Refactored the backend of a note taking app deployed through heroku. The app is meant to allow the user to create notes that lets them save or delete them. The app should display sample notes but i could not get it to do so. 

## Installation
Go to my GitHub (github.com/snerowski), find the repo Mega_Note_Taker repo, and there is a link in the README, simply click the link.

## Usage 
From the website the user can open the page and it is very intuitive, click anywhere and start typing to use the note then the plus button in the top right corner to save it.
